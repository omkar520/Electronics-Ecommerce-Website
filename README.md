🚀 Super excited to share that I’ve successfully developed an E-Commerce Website for Electronics Products using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla), PHP & MySQL! 💻⚡

🛍️ Main Website Features:
🔐 User Authentication – Login & Registration system
🏠 Home Page – Clean and responsive UI
🔍 Search Functionality – Find products easily
📂 Product Categories – Organized product browsing
👁️ Quick View – Instantly see product details
🛒 Shopping Cart – Add, view, and manage selected items

🛠️ Admin Panel Functionalities:
📊 Dashboard Overview – Quick glance at site activity
👤 Admin Profile Management – Update admin details
📦 Order Management – View Pending & Completed orders
➕ Product Management – Add, edit, or remove products
👥 User & Admin Control – Manage user and admin accounts
📨 Message Center – View messages sent by customers

🔧 This project helped me strengthen my full-stack web development skills and gave me real-world experience in building scalable, user-friendly applications.

Would love your feedback and suggestions! 😊
